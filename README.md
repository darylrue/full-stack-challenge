### Prerequisites

* [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) is installed
* [Angular](https://angular.io/cli) is installed
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed

NOTES:
* For convenience, script files have been provided for installing a local instance of PostgreSQL, and for starting and stopping the database.
To install your local postgres database, run install_local_db.sh. After this script has been run, you can then start and stop your database by running *run_local_db.sh* and *stop_local_db.sh* respectively. Please note these scripts are for linux / mac systems. If you are using Windows you can run them with WSL or just run the commands inside the script files directly.
* Feel free to clone this repository to get started, but make sure you use your own remote repo for your work.
